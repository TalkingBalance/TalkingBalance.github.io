On this website you'll find download and set up instructions, as well as some FAQ's and our contact details if you'd like to get in touch. Getting started To use this program, first ensure that you have access to a pair of scientific scales which are supported. These don't have to be special talking scales, they just need to support connecting to a computer via serial. You'll find a few recommended models on the recommended hardware page. You'll also need a couple of inexpensive adaptors to connect your computer to your scales, as most modern computers don't have a serial port. Once you've got everything ready, just download our program, click it to run it, and get started. Hopefully, after that, you will have a talking balance! Contacting us If you have any issues with the program or would just like to get in touch, you can use the details on our contact us page. We will respond to you as soon as we can.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#home","text":"Welcome to Talking Balance, a program you can use to make your scientific scales talk!

Therefore, I started out on a mission to get some scales made accessible. At first I tried the simple solutions. Seeing AI totally failed to work due to the type of LED screens on the scales, and when the school got some scales that could connect to their data logger app on the school iPad's the information wasn't properly accessible in the app. Therefore, my mentor Ben and I started work on a small program that could run on a Windows computer or Mac and could read out the mass from scales that would connect to the computer. The program now also allows to control functions of the scales, such as to tare them, using simple hot-keys. With this solution, I can now weigh out my own amounts of chemicals to use in experiments as independently as my sighted peers using my laptop and a standard scientific balance connected to it. We hope that more students get the chance to use Talking Balance as being able to do science experiments independently is important, fun, and is even required for A Levels.","title":"About"},{"location":"about/#about","text":"","title":"About"},{"location":"about/#about_1","text":"When I started secondary school, there were no accessible scientific balances available that I could use to do my practicals in Science.

We like the xxxxx as it's a more affordable option but still has all the essential features and most-importantly full support for the program including remote control via hot keys. The xxxxx are a more expensive set of scales with a higher weight limit and more accurate measurements. It might be worth asking your school or local council to purchase these if you need to do very accurate measurements in practicals. These scales have equally good support for the program and support all the remote control features.","title":"Recommended hardware"},{"location":"hardware/#recommended-hardware","text":"Although the program works with most scales that support serial connections, we thought we'd highlight some models that work well for us.
